# IMDb_Analysis
Analysis of the top 50 000 IMDb movies.
For this project, we scraped data from the top 50 000 IMDb movies by looking at:

    Supply side : how many movies are produced yearly and does this number change over time?
    Demand side: do users prefer certain genres over others? which are the most produced and rated types of movies?
    Popularity among general audience: How is popularity among general audience? what is the variation of rating over years and by genres?
    Popularity among professional audience: what is the relationship between the popularity among professional audience, the genre, and the rating average of movies?
    Viewership behavoir: what is the average duration of movie to keep audience focused and happy?
    
We then built classification tree model and used the attributes of the movies to find out which variables are the most important to determine the success of a movie.
